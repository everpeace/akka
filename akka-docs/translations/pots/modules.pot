msgid "Akka supports a set of durable mailboxes. A durable mailbox is a replacement for the standard actor mailbox that is durable. What this means in practice is that if there are pending messages in the actor's mailbox when the node of the actor resides on crashes, then when you restart the node, the actor will be able to continue processing as if nothing had happened; with all pending messages still in its mailbox."
